# Flappy Bird Game

## Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Python and Pygame library. The game involves controlling a bird to navigate through gaps between pipes without colliding with them.

## Features
- Bird jumping mechanic: Press the spacebar to make the bird jump and avoid obstacles.
- Pipe obstacles: Randomly generated pipes that the bird must navigate through.
- Score tracking: Keep track of the player's score and best score achieved.
- High score persistence: Store and update the best score even after closing the game.
- Smooth bird animation: Flapping wings animation for the bird.

## Installation
To run the game, ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system. You can install Pygame using pip:

```
pip install pygame
```

Clone or download the repository to your local machine and run the `main.py` file to start the game.

## Controls
- Press the spacebar to make the bird jump and avoid obstacles.

## Gameplay
Navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes by timing your jumps carefully. Each successful pass through a gap earns you one point. The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or reaches the top or bottom of the screen.
